__Theme for Atom (Access to Memory)__

This theme is for version 2.5. Previous versions will probably not work.

__Some features__

* By default, Atom permissions allow descriptions to be read in browse lists, sidebar facets, "Popular this week" list. This theme removes any items that a specific user, or user group, doesn't have permissions to read;
* The "Popular this week" box gets a bigger highlight;
* The first element of the "Popular this week" also shows its thumbnail (if it exists);
